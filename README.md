# PID-Controller-Design-and-Closed-Loop-System-Response-Analysis_Controls_3.2B
Utilizing the Ziegler-Nichols’ first method for PID tuning, write a  MATLAB-Simulink program to design a PID controller to improve the tracking  performance of the given system. Please remember obtain the parameters 𝑲𝒑, 𝑻𝒊, and  𝑻𝒅 of the PID controller based on the Ziegler-Nichols’ first method for PID tuning (You  can do this step by hand or by programming). Then clearly show the transfer function  of the PID controller. Finally, plot and compare the responses of the open-loop and  closed-loop systems to a unit-step reference signal. Please remember to label the axes  and title the plot. Is the PID controller tuned by the Ziegler-Nichols’ first method able to  improve the tracking performance of the given system? Clearly state your observations  and conclusions. You may write your design steps, observations, and conclusions as  comments in your MATLAB program.
